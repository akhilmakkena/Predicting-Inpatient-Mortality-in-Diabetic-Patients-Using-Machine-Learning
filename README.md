This main aim of this project is to build a high-performance machine learning models to predict a surrogate measure of the quality of diabetes care that is given in a hospital. To set a background, the research is based on the results of the UK National Diabetes Inpatient Audit (NaDIA) of 2018 that involves remote blood glucose monitoring as a proxy outcome of the high-quality care environment implemented in a hospital. The proxy theoretically correlates lower inpatient mortality risk and allows exploring the institutional features, which prompt the implementation of advanced care technologies.
